There are several types of record held including: Benchmarks, Design targets, Energy predictive modelling results, Results from Building Regulations UK Part L (BRUKL) Compliance Certificates, Results from Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), Results from Display Energy Certificates (DECs), energy values from Utility meters or bills, and energy values from other installed meters.  |

|                                              | The database system was originally developed by David Hawkins for use by Max Fordham LLP and Feilden Clegg Bradley LLP. David carried out the work whilst completing an Engineering Doctorate at UCL, although it was not the topic of his doctorate. This work was funded jointly by Max Fordham LLP and Feilden Clegg Bradley LLP.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                                              | The EnergyTracker tool has then been rebuilt from scratch by Matt Clapham funded by FCB, with ongoing input and comment from Max Fordham. This tool is now approaching usable beta status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
